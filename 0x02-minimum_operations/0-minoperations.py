"""
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute
only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n,
write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result
in exactly n H characters in the file.
Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All
=> Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
